INTRODUCTION:
Online trading becomes more common these days due to the development in trading technologies such as trading software, easy online connection with the markets, and advanced trading strategies. Two type of online trading that consider more feasible if the one can learn their essential keys of success:
1)	Stock Market.
2)	Currency Market.
Each type has a different form of trading. For instance, currency market includes different types of trading such as Forex trading, Binary Option trading, and spread trading, etc. However, all this forms of trading need to be studied well through a huge amount of collected data for many years to make the trading strategies more accurate and the market movement prediction more reliable.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Currency trading and all other online investment market are very risky for the people who don’t know how to deal with such type of trading and they may lose their money capital of investment if they don`t have a profitable, accurate, and feasible strategy to enter the market and to trade confidently. The high level confident trading strategy depends on the good analysis of the market movement data that can be done by two type of analysis:
1)	Fundamental analysis 
2)	Technical analysis
These two types are the main types of analysis for such kind of markets. The fundamental analysis is the analysis that depends on the data that relevant to the news that may affect the movement of the markets. These data includes many aspect such as news impact level, news release date, and news categories etc. and these type of data are collected from many sources and websites that provide these services either for free or for a specific amount of money, depends on the quality of service.
In the other hand, Technical analysis is the analysis that depends on the data that relevant to the currency pairs or the stock itself. And these data including but not limited to:
-	Liquidity of the currency pairs.
-	Volume data.
-	Ask price data
-	Bid price data
-	Start time and end time for the Japanese candles.
-	Market pattern data 
All these kind of data need to be analyzed for a sufficient period of time and integrated together to build a more accurate strategy system with high profit and less losing percentage.  

OBJECTIVE:
The goals of this project is to utilize all the available data that can be collected from a public sources to build a high level strategy system for currency trading by three stages: 
1)	Build two types of indicators:
•	Main indicators: which give a signal for a predicted market movement based on a collected data for more than 10 years.
•	Minor indicators: that work as a filter for signal noise to reduce a fake signal calls and add more restricted rules and conditions for entering the market.
2)	Build a robot software wich is called Expert Advisor (EA) to implement all the trading process automatically such as the time of entering the market, the time of collect the profit and get out of the market, the amount of invested money, take profit limit, and stop loss limit etc.
3)	Combine the two major analysis type of market which are the Fundamental and Technical Analysis to enhance the system and make it more reliable with a high level of confidence.
Note: (the first two stages are already done).
The programing language that used to utilize the data and do all the goals of the project is called MQL4 language, which is the language that used specifically for programming a trading strategies through indicators and Expert Advisors robots. And its syntax is based on C language.
